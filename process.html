Although I follow this process but I am highly flexible to be able to reiterate and redefine some of the requirements. <br><br>The key benefit I get mostly out of this is getting as much requirements as possible during the design phase to avoid changes during developement, prototypes and design changes can be reworked in a matter of minutes whereas changing code might take up to a week if a feature has not been implemented correctly.</p>

                    <p class="process_descr">
                        Before I can do anything the very first step is try to define the product, I setup a meeting with the client and hear what is it that they're building and try to get the reasons behind the idea and the whole overall problem they're trying to solve. I ask relevant questions to try to understand its context for existence.<br><i> Phase key aspects include the following.</i><br><br><strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong><br>interviewing key stakeholders to gather insights about business goals.<br><br><strong>Value proposition mapping</strong><br>Thinking about the key aspects and value propositions of the product: what it is, who will use it, and why they will use it. This helped me and stakeholders create consensus around what the product will be and how to match user and business needs.
                        <br><br><strong>Concept sketching</strong><br>Creating an early mockup of the future product (usually a low-fidelity paper sketches of the product’s architecture).

                    <p class="process_descr">
                        Once I’ve defined the idea, I then move to the research phase. This phase typically includes both user research and market research. I think of research as a good investment—good research informs design decisions and investing in research early in the process can save a lot of time and money down the road.<br><i> Phase key aspects include the following.</i><br><br><strong>Individual in-depth interviews</strong><br>A great product experience starts with a good understanding of the users. In-depth interviews provide qualitative data about the target audience, such as their needs, wants, fears, motivations, and behavior.<br><br><strong>Competitive research</strong><br>This helps me to understand industry standards and identify opportunities for the product within its particular niche.

                    <p class="process_descr">
                        The aim of the analysis phase is to draw insights from data collected during the research phase, moving from “what” users want/think/need to “why” they want/think/need it. During this phase, I confirm that my most important assumptions are correct.<br><i> Phase key aspects include the following.</i><br><br><strong>Creating user personas</strong><br> With Personas I create fictional characters that represent the different user types for your product.<br><br><strong>Creating user stories</strong><br>I ise user stories as a tool to understand the product/service interactions from the user’s point of view. Usually defined with the following structure: “As a [user] I want to [goal to achieve] so that [motivation].”

                    <p class="process_descr">
                        When users’ wants, needs, and expectations from a product are clear, I then move to the design phase. At this step, I work on various activities, from creating information architecture (IA) to the actual UI design.<br><i> Phase key aspects include the following.</i><br><br><strong>Creating wireframes</strong><br>Wireframing allows me to focus on the content, visual hierarchy and accessibility of the website/app. Designing of how pretty components look is not be the primary goal of the product at this stage because at the end of the day people don't use products because of how slick it looks they want to accomplish something and so wireframes are a way of testing if the product does accomplish what it claims to accomplish without hurting the usability.
                        <br><br><strong>Creating prototypes</strong><br>While wireframes are mostly about structure and visual hierarchy (the look), prototypes are about creating the actual interaction experience (the look and feel).

                </div>
                <div class="work__img">

                    </div>
                    <p class="process_descr">
                        Validation is an essential step in the design process because it helps me understand whether the design works for the users. Usually, I usualy start validation phase after the high-fidelity design is ready, since testing with high-fidelity designs provides more valuable feedback from end-users and client). If anything needs to be redesigned or defined from this stage I go ahead and do so.<br>

                        After the design and prototype has been complete and I have to develop the product as well I go ahead with the developemnt using the exact design resources and style.
                        <br><i> Phase key aspects include the following.</i><br><br><strong>Front-End Development</strong><br>This stage involves just creating the look and feel of the designs with code and just creating static iteractions of the product with Javascript, leaving the dynamic content to back end developemnt.<br><br><strong>Value proposition mapping</strong>
                        <br><br><strong>Back-End Development</strong><br>I usually start off my backend development by designing the models of the products and how they will work with each other, go ahead and implement them on the project. After that I create the flow of content on the views and other files.
